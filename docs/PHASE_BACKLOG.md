**What fixed half-frame / multi-panel tears**

1. **`frame_store`**: dual-bank writes to non-display bank; `swap_pending`; **flip display bank only on `vsync_pulse`**; **hold writes while pending** (no mid-scan flip, no multi-panel overwrite).
2. **`ddram_frame_rd`**: **hold DDR→BRAM DMA while `swap_pending`**; queue one latest doorbell/SPI kick; mmap doorbell `0x3007F000` (`PLXK`).
3. **Host (`misterplexd`)**: product cast = **STREAM=0 every-frame DDR F1** (not STREAM recon); **wall-48 kHz MrAudio**; doorbell-preferred present; **heal Main on stop**.

**Evidence**

- holdoff2: half/mid/multi tear rates **0.00/s** — `captures/e2e/tc_glitch/holdoff2/REPORT.txt`
- Blip 24 fps Web cast: median flash↔beep **~−13 ms** — `captures/e2e/blip24/avsync_report.txt` (+ suite notes in `captures/e2e/REPORT*.md`)
- Do **not** thrash this RBF while product path is green unless a new present gate fails.
- Residual csum / WIDE / 3l2 below are **separate** serial tracks (historical RBF ids do not supersede product **`1441d409`** present path).

## ACTIVE — Hardware visual decode regression harness (**HW RED/GREEN PROVEN** 2026-07-27)

User directive: after simulation, build realtime, push to MiSTer, and validate on real DE10-Nano hardware with
visual unit tests/debug output instead of stopping at Verilator.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Branch** | `feat/c1-hw-visual` |
| **Harness** | `tests/hw/test_f3_visual_golden.sh` |
| **Comparator** | `scripts/hw_visual_compare.py` |
| **Goldens** | no silent default; `VISUAL_GOLDEN` must name a hardware-captured PNG with `.provenance.json` |
| **Docs** | [`hw-visual-regression.md`](hw-visual-regression.md) |
| **Status** | **EVIDENCE-BACKED for the legacy rollback instrument only:** real HDMI capture achieved; `57674f2e` grades GREEN and characterized bad `fe7673bc` grades RED. **UNSUBSTANTIATED for current product decode:** the `57674f2e` golden is RGB565/320×240 rollback evidence and must not grade the current YUV420/624×480 path. |

**Design:** push a known Baseline/CAVLC F3 vector, capture HDMI, derive thresholds from five repeated static
captures, compare the stable decoded ROI (default `VISUAL_COMPARE_BOX=11,0,160,120`, containing MB0), and emit
`golden | captured | amplified-diff` PNG plus JSON metrics. The comparator can still use the shared host/RTL DDR
layout active region for future 624×480 gates.

**Dry-run evidence:** `make unit` exit 0. Synthetic/checked-in noise floor is zero
(`max_pair_mae_rgb=[0,0,0]`, `max_abs_noise=0`, thresholds `[1,1,1]` / `2`), and the comparator's red-path unit
corrupts one active pixel and fails with exact worst coordinate + diff artifact.

**Capture/freshness/artifact integrity:** compare exit codes are distinct: `1` = real visual mismatch, `3` =
stale frame, `4` = V4L2/FFmpeg corrupted buffer/data, `5` = absent device, `6` = busy device, `7` = no fresh
frame delivery proven from status counters/token, `8` = loaded/golden RBF md5 does not match the declared
artifact, `9` = missing/mismatched golden provenance. Capture-rig, delivery, wrong-core, or unscoped-golden
failure is never accepted as either green or known-red core evidence.

**Hardware evidence (W-C1 token window):**

- Differential test: the exact W-CAP YUYV pipelines also report full-frame corrupt buffers on the MiSTer menu
  (`1843200` bytes at 1280×720@10 and `614400` bytes at 640×480@10), so this is a raw-YUYV capture-pipeline
  problem rather than evidence that Plex alone emits bad HDMI timing.
- Repaired capture path: `/dev/video4` MJPEG `1280x720@60`; menu capture was clean, YUYV 640×480@5 with
  120-frame warm-up still reported full-frame corruption. `v4l2-ctl` advertises MJPEG 720p60/1080p30 and YUYV
  720p only at 10 fps; dongle is on a shared 480M USB bus.
- W-CAP's real `fe7673bc959f37fd7da44e8a865f7db3` YUYV failure logs (`Dequeued v4l2 buffer contains corrupted
  data`, `/dev/video4`, 10 fps, 1280×720 corrupt bytes `1843200`, 640×480 corrupt bytes `614400`) are now checked
  in as capture-log fixtures and force `compare --capture-log ...` to return `rc=4` before pixel grading.
- Measured static capture noise floor on `57674f2e` default ROI: `max_pair_mae_rgb=[0,0,0]`, `max_abs_noise=0`;
  thresholds `[1,1,1]` / `2`.
- Green rollback `57674f2e`: exact ROI pixels `19200/19200`, MAE `[0,0,0]`, max_abs `0`, `rc=0`.
- Red specimen `fe7673bc`: telemetry has `res_csum=20`/`raw[13]=0x14` class signal while reconstruction is known
  bad; visual compare exact ROI pixels `0/19200`, MAE RGB `[112.7730,59.8615,61.0523]`, max_abs `242`,
  `rc=1`, diff artifact emitted.
- Tooling no longer has a proven default pair. The former
  `plex_real_baseline_320x240_57674f2e_mjpeg720_golden.png` is quarantined as
  legacy rollback evidence only; its sidecar declares `57674f2e`, 320×240,
  RGB565, BT.601/full, and ROI `11,0,160,120`. The 624×480 reference is
  retained only as a future target and is marked `generated_reference`, so the
  hardware harness refuses to grade it as a captured golden.
- Stale-screen follow-up: Plex reload+push captures can exact-match a golden while status reports `bytes_in=4`.
  Source audit proved this is a status-telemetry alias (`bytes_in == nalu == 4`, four NALs, not four bytes)
  after stream byte telemetry was reclaimed for residual/recon RCA. The comparator now names the
  `STATUS_TELEMETRY_LAYER` and refuses that phantom-green path before pixel grading (`rc=7`) using the natural
  captured fixture; unit coverage also proves a fresh legacy-style `bytes_in=6227` plus changed
  `{bank,format,seq}` token green path.
- Wrong-core follow-up: rollback `57674f2e` predates the current YUV420/624×480 frame-store contract, so it cannot
  validate the current ARM I420 delivery path. The hardware script now requires `VISUAL_RBF` or
  `VISUAL_EXPECTED_RBF_MD5`, verifies device `/media/fat/_Utility/Plex.rbf`, requires `VISUAL_GOLDEN`, and the
  comparator refuses loaded-vs-golden source mismatches before pixel grading (`rc=8`) with both core md5s in the
  error. Unit coverage proves wrong/undeclared RBF red, golden-source mismatch red, and matching md5 green.

**Hardware TODO:**

- [x] Get W-CAP's actual corrupted V4L2 command/log/device/artifacts and add the logs as rc=4 harness specimens.
- [x] Record real HDMI capture noise floor from `build/hw_visual_accept/noise_good_57674f2e.json`.
- [x] Prove green visual compare against rollback `57674f2e`.
- [x] Prove red path on hardware with known-bad `fe7673bc`.
- [x] Quarantine the former 320×240 `57674f2e` golden; no silent default golden remains.
- [x] Refuse full-frame `VISUAL_FULL_FRAME=1` coverage by default. Hardware investigation of the 618×480 active
  region false-reded on known-good `57674f2e` despite zero within-run noise: exact `281458/296640`,
  Y/U/V MAE `[5.1175,3.3041,1.9793]` vs checked golden, and `281249/296640`, Y/U/V MAE
  `[5.1944,3.3532,2.0109]` after rerun against a same-window full golden. Bad `fe7673bc` was red
  (`0/296640`, Y/U/V MAE `[63.9724,24.5320,26.1278]`), but a full-frame gate cannot ship until good is green.
- [x] Add a freshness/delivery guard so a stale frozen screen cannot grade as PASS. `compare --status-log`
  refuses the `bytes_in=4`/`nalu=4` status-telemetry alias before pixel grading (`rc=7`) and supports the shared DDR frame token
  `{bank,format,seq}` for w-a3/w-cap alignment.
- [x] Add loaded-artifact identity gating. The hardware script records and verifies `md5sum
  /media/fat/_Utility/Plex.rbf`; compare refuses wrong or undeclared RBF identity (`rc=8`) before grading pixels.
  Status `frame_debug=0xe1` is surfaced as a named non-YUV doorbell/debug refusal.
- [ ] Promote a checked-in host/good 624×480 golden only after that vector is live and green on rollback hardware.

## Decode evidence reconciliation (2026-07-27)

Status labels below distinguish measured evidence from retired instrumentation:

| Claim area | Evidence status | Measurement / instrument |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| MB0 first-pixel/root-cause localization | **EVIDENCE-BACKED** | Native-I420 full-frame scoreboard (`tools/score_h264_native_frames.cpp`, `tests/unit/test_stream_path_full_frame_compare.sh`) reports the old phantom first-pixel divergence as clean: `got=73 ref=73 abs=0`. The retired RGB565/presentation scoreboard had reported `got=142 ref=65`, so that older failure was an instrument artifact, not decoder evidence. |
| Full-frame intra prediction exactness | **EVIDENCE-BACKED on undeblocked native I420** | The former “300/300 exact”/`maeY=0` frame-wide green was measured through the RGB565 diagnostic/presentation path with border masking, then the first native-I420 ratchet still mismatched loop-filter state. The corrected native-I420 ratchets now declare/refuse H.264 loop-filter state, make the loop-filter contract explicit, and compare undeblocked RTL/host recon against FFmpeg `-skip_loop_filter all`: `624x480 12f` intra `1170/1170` MB exact, Y/U/V MAE `0`; `320x240 12f` intra `300/300` MB exact, Y/U/V MAE `0`; `wcap_residual14_idr_plus_p` intra `300/300` MB exact. |
| P-slice / motion compensation full-frame output | **MEASURED RED / EXPECTED-RED / OWNER W-REL** | Product `stream_path` parser now drives DPB/MC liveness through the product deblock writeback commit barrier (`recon_sig_3b_cycles=39780`, forced-`recon_sig=0` red). Native-I420 ratchets still classify P frames as expected-red until native inter/DPB plane output is wired (`11/11` P frames for both 12-frame fixtures and `1/1` for the wcap fixture). The current observable full-frame output is still diagnostic RGB565 converted back to I420, so it is not a native decode PASS; against `ffmpeg -skip_loop_filter all`, inter quality remains measured red while standalone DPB/MC RTL tests remain evidence-backed. |
| Visual hardware golden `plex_real_baseline_320x240_57674f2e_mjpeg720_golden.png` | **EVIDENCE-BACKED only for rollback `57674f2e`; contaminated for current-product claims** | Sidecar declares rollback RBF `57674f2e`, 320×240 RGB565, BT.601/full, ROI `11,0,160,120`. It is quarantined as legacy evidence and must not grade current YUV420/624×480 delivery or decode status. |
| `bytes_in` status freshness | **EVIDENCE-BACKED alias, not byte count** | ARM/status parser currently maps `bytes_in` to `nalu_count`; `bytes_in=4` means four NALs (SPS/PPS/SEI/IDR), not four bytes. Visual gates must use status/token freshness and reject the stale-screen phantom (`rc=7`) before pixel grading. |
| DDR present / frame-store mailbox on current silicon | **UNSUBSTANTIATED / HARDWARE BLOCKED** | W-CAP silicon evidence on loaded `eeff4eee` (proven source `b5c50c6`): valid `PLXK` doorbell (`lo=0x504c584b`, `hi=0xa0000068`, bank=1, format=YUV420P, seq=0x68) but `PLXF` frame mailbox stayed all-zero (`lo=0x00000000 hi=0x00000000`) for 40 samples over 12.3 s and `has_frame=0`. Simulation of the same mailbox path reads `MAGIC_F=0x504c5846`; a later line-read hang simulation is a distinct **stale** fault (`PLXF` magic remains `0x504c5846`, e.g. `plxf=0x8001504c5846`, while `has_frame=0`). Pre-deploy discriminator: `PLXF lo=0x00000000` means the first frame-mailbox write never reached/read back at `0x3007F118` (reset/clock/DDR grant/write-address/netlist class); `PLXF lo=0x504c5846` with static high word means the mailbox published and a later frame-fill/present path stalled. Until a provenance-correct post-`d803e4c`/`86558c4`/`97beb1d` RBF is fitted and observed, claims that the DDR frame-store/present path works on device are not current evidence. |
| Current localized intra defect | **EVIDENCE-BACKED LOCALIZATION / ROOT CAUSE OPEN** | No-deblock native-I420 localization finds the first real mismatch at MB 182 = `(26,4)`, luma `Y(420,72)`: `got=107 ref=145`, I16x16 vertical, QP 0, pred=106, AC all zero, dequant DC=60, IDCT=1. This points at DC scaling collapse, not MB(0,0), prediction, or CAVLC. |

Any future green decode claim must name the exact evidence file, fixture, and instrument. A claim that cannot state whether it came from native I420 planes, RGB565 presentation diagnostics, hardware HDMI capture, or host-only reference code stays **UNSUBSTANTIATED**.

**Gates**

- [x] G-AV0 zero intentional lag (`AUDIO_DELAY_MS=0`) — lab conf default; no hardcoded lag
- [x] G-AV1 Trek-matched blip fixture — `assets/avsync/sync_trekmatch_*` PMS keys **9/10**
- [x] G-AV2 measure harness flash↔beep — **PASS** HDMI trekmatch RK10 n=12; `captures/e2e/avsync_trekmatch/`
- [ ] G-AV3 blip \|median\| ≤ 1 frame @24p (≤42 ms) — **superseded by G-AV7**; the old absolute number was unmeasurable while the A/V origin race added ±35 ms per play
- [x] G-AV8 video paces off audible position — **PASS**: `/dev/MrAudio` has a 512 KB DMA ring with **no backpressure** (10 s of PCM accepted in 116 ms), so the old submitted-byte clock ran ahead of what was heard. The driver's `open()`+`read()` exposes `len:` = bytes queued-but-unplayed; the pump now samples it (EMA-smoothed) and the present loop paces off `(written - queued)`. Measured steady-state depth **~35,000 B ≈ 185 ms** — sampled *mid-playback*; the 19 ms/4 B first readings were startup and end-of-clip artifacts. The depth is **session-dependent** (it is FFmpeg's startup latency, dumped into the ring by the pump's catch-up burst and then held there because feed and drain are both 48 kHz), which is the likely source of this project's run-to-run lipsync variance. Ring overwrite is now logged instead of silently corrupting lipsync.
- [x] G-AV10 ring depth bounded and self-correcting — **PASS**: the first sustained measurement showed the ring growing **+255 B/s (~80 ms/min)**, which overruns the 512 KB ring ~31 min in and silently shreds unplayed audio. Cause: `AUDIO_CLOCK_PPM=+685` had the **wrong sign** (true error ~**-638 ppm**) because it was calibrated under the submitted-byte clock, where a filling ring and a fast playback clock look identical. Replaced the open-loop constant with a proportional servo on the measured depth (`feedRateBytesPerSec`, target ~100 ms, tau 8 s, ±1 % clamp); also anchored the pump clock on the first chunk (kills the session-dependent FFmpeg warm-up burst) and fixed `decodeOsdWord` returning a hardcoded 685 that clobbered `AUDIO_CLOCK_PPM` on every OSD poll. Hardware, TNG 40868 @3:54 120 s: depth **97-101 ms flat** (19198-19231 B vs 19200 B target), `audio_s == wall_s`, **drops 0** (was 1), 0 overrun warnings, Main pid stable.
- [x] G-AV4 Trek eyes-on — **PASS** (S1E1 **40868**): user eyes-on settled on **video delay +80 ms**. Root cause of the reported "half a second" was the knob turned the wrong way: the menu read `A/V offset` and never said which stream moved, so `-160 ms` pushed video *further* ahead (−160 → +80 is a 240 ms swing). Menu is now `Video delay` (positive = video later). **The +80 is not transferable to the new clock** — it was tuned while video paced off submitted bytes, so it silently absorbed that session's ring depth (see G-AV8). The default is therefore reset to **0 ms** and needs one fresh eyes-on pass; tracked as G-AV9.
- [x] G-AV9 retune `Video delay` under the audible clock — **PASS at 0 ms, no constant needed.** User eyes-on, real TNG S1E1 `40868` @ 3:54 (23.976 → `fps=24000/1001`, HEVC transcode), `osd lo=0x0000` / `av_offset_ms=0`: "audio looks in sync right now". The old +80 ms was **entirely** the MrAudio ring depth the submitted-byte clock was silently carrying; with the audible clock and the feed servo there is nothing left to trim. This is the answer to the original question — Plex Web needs no constant because it schedules against the hardware playback position, and now so do we.
- [x] G-AV11 HDMI grabber calibration — the flash/beep harness read **-215 ms** at the same setting the user's eyes call in-sync, so **the USB grabber's own A/V skew is about -215 ms** (video and audio arrive as independent USB streams). `tests/hw/avsync_measure.py` is therefore a **relative/drift instrument only**; add **+215 ms** to treat a reading as absolute, and never bake a constant from it without eyes-on confirmation.
- [x] G-VID1 VGA/HDMI 1 px edge wrap — **RESOLVED (build `dfebf2bf`).** Symptom: the column falling
  off the right edge reappeared as a vertical bar on the far LEFT ("like word wrap"), plus a
  duplicated bottom line.
  **Two independent defects, both in `present_core.sv`:**
  1. *Horizontal.* `hc → fr` costs ~4 clk (`store_x` on `ce_pix` = 2, `frame_store`
     `rd_addr_r → rd_q → rd_r` = 3) while `hc → hb` costs 1, so pixel data lagged its own DE.
     Fix: delay `hb`/`hs` by `DE_LAG` — **not** `vb`/`vs`. Advancing `read_hc` can never fix this
     and burned many cycles. `DE_LAG = 3` was *measured*, not guessed (sweep 3/4/5/6 built in
     parallel: 3 → col0 w=6px, col319 w=4px ✅; 4 → 4/7; 5 → col0 missing/11; 6 → missing/14).
  2. *The blank-time reset was the actual wrap.* `store_x <= in_content ? store_x_clamped : 0`
     handed **column 0** to any pixel addressed outside `in_content` — which, with DE delayed, is
     the tail of every line. It also *masked* left-edge errors. Fix: drive `store_x` unconditionally
     from the clamped counter.
  3. *Vertical.* `colorbars.sv` moves the V blank edges at `hc == H_SYNC_S` (544), i.e. **after**
     each line's active region, so `VBlank` releases a line early and line 240 is displayed;
     `de_out` never checked `py < 240`, so that row fetched `store_y = 240` — one past the store.
     Fix: `past_last_row = (py >= 240)` folded into `vb_d`, plus a clamped `store_y`.
     Proven by stripe pitch: 1035/1044/1053/1062/1071 = 1080/**241**; after the fix
     1038/1047/1056/1065/1074 and top at 2/9/18/27/36 = 1080/**240**.
  **Verification is now automated and self-checking** — `scripts/gen_edge_markers.py` pushes a
  synthetic marker frame and `scripts/check_edges.py` captures HDMI and grades all four edges on
  both position and run width (exit 0 = pass). Reports `PASS: all four edges correct`, and live
  TNG shows col0↔col319 r=0.33 / row0↔row239 r=0.13 (no wrap). **User confirmed all four edges
  eyes-on on VGA (2026-07-26)** — left/right after the horizontal fix, bottom after the 241st-row
  fix. Closed.
  *Measurement traps worth remembering:* MJPEG 4:2:0 **fabricates** colours at 1 px saturated
  boundaries (use `-input_format yuyv422` and luma-coded markers); `/dev/video4` needs ~60 warm-up
  frames; captures right after a DDR push can be torn — validate with solid white/black first.
- [ ] G-LIB1 missing PMS item silently plays the test pattern — a deleted/renumbered ratingKey 404s, but PMS returns an HTML error *body*, so the old `!xml.empty()` check passed and resolve fell through to `testsrc2`. Cost a full session of measurements attributed to Star Trek that were actually the test pattern. Now detected via `<MediaContainer` and reported as "no such item on PMS". **TNG is no longer in the library** (section 2 holds only ThunderCats; 40868/40710 both 404) — G-AV9 eyes-on needs it re-added.
- [x] G-AV5 exact content rate — log `content fps exact=24000/1001` (Trek/RK11) vs `24/1` (RK12) from identical `videoFrameRate="24p"` metadata; `test_avclock` in `make unit`
- [x] G-AV6 drift slope ≤ 10 ms/min — **+0.79 / −0.67 / +1.79** ms/min (RK11) and **−2.21** (RK12), 240 s single-capture fits; before **−53.3**; `tests/hw/avsync_rate.py`
- [x] G-AV7 constant offset ≤ 42 ms — **PASS via G-AV4**: the residual was a real, constant video lead, not grabber skew. Instrumented capture said +60 ms (|median| 36 ms, `avsync_trekmatch_d60`) and eyes-on said +80 ms — two independent measures one step apart, so the default is evidence-backed, not guessed.
- [x] G-SEEK1 mid-play seekTo ±1 s — blip key=6 seek 12s → playing ~15.5s
- [x] G-SEEK2 resume/continue-watching ≠0 — playMedia offset=15s → playing ~19s
- [x] G-SEEK3 unit regression — `make unit` PASS + `universalOffsetSeconds(234000)==234`
- [x] G-REG tear RBF unchanged unless proven needed — leave **`1441d409`** alone

`kOsdOwnedMask = 0xC3CA`. Removed from the menu: Content FPS, Pattern, Audio tone, Force bars —
`pattern`, `audio_en` and `use_frame_store` are hardwired to `0` in `Plex.sv`, preserving the prior defaults.

### Hard rule (non-obvious trap)

**The daemon must NEVER write user OSD bits.** Main_MiSTer owns the OSD word and persists it to
`/media/fat/config/Plex_v3.CFG`. Any daemon-side `setStatusBits()` on those bits fights Main's shadow copy —
observed flapping `0x01c0 ↔ 0x0000` every poll. Removing all daemon writes made it rock-stable for 30 s+.
This is why `pushContentFpsBits()` / `restoreOsd()` / `osd_state.txt` were reverted. Polling is read-only.

**Gates**

- [x] G-OSD1 live core carries the v3 menu — `set_status --confstr` dumps the exact expected CONF_STR from the running core
- [x] G-OSD2 OSD renders with live values — `/tmp/osd5.png` via `tests/hw/osd_keys.py` (uinput F12), labels + values correct
- [x] G-OSD3 all four controls decode and apply live — `0x00c0`→+60 ms, `0x40c0`→idle=1, `0x40ca`→trim+resync off, `0x020a`→−160 ms; verified **mid-playback**
- [x] G-OSD4 A/V offset measurably moves lipsync — OSD +140 ms → median **−62.15 ms** vs baseline **+94.0 ms** = **−156 ms** delta
- [x] G-IDLE idle screen replaces the stuck last frame — `/tmp/idle3.png`, `/tmp/idle_afterstop.png`; amber chevron on near-black after stop
- [x] G-OSD-UNIT bit layout pinned — `tests/unit/test_osd_menu.cpp` in `make unit` (12 suites green)
- [ ] G-OSD5 arrow-key menu navigation eyes-on — **PENDING user**: `/dev/uinput` F12 works, **arrows do not register**, so lab automation cannot drive the menu end-to-end
- [x] G-OSD6 **F12/OSD invisible (2026-07-26)** — **RESOLVED. Root cause: a wedged MiSTer `Main`.**
  F12 came back by itself after a reboot, with zero RTL changes. `Main` had spun forever in the
  GPO/SPI ACK handshake; while wedged it stops servicing the HPS<->FPGA link, so it never writes
  `io_osd_vga`/`io_strobe`/`io_din` and the OSD simply has nothing to draw. Same wedge also made it
  silently drop `/dev/MiSTer_cmd`, so `load_core` was a no-op (see G-VID1).
  **Two earlier diagnoses were WRONG — recorded so they are not repeated:**
  1. "SPI sharing in `d9941de` starves Main's OSD writes." Disproven: F12 stayed dead with
     `misterplexd` fully stopped.
  2. "`sys/video_mixer.sv` / `sys/osd.v` are never instantiated." Disproven: `video_mixer.sv`
     contains **no OSD at all**, and `sys/sys_top.v` **is** the top-level entity
     (`Plex.qsf:11: TOP_LEVEL_ENTITY sys_top`), instantiating `osd hdmi_osd` (line 1183) and
     `osd vga_osd` (line 1403) via `sys/sys.qip`. The framework composites the OSD regardless of
     whether the core uses `video_mixer`; routing through `video_mixer` would NOT have fixed F12.
  **Follow-up (open, tracked as G-STAB2):** find what wedges `Main` in the first place.
  **Liveness test — the only valid one:** `load_core /media/fat/menu.rbf`, then confirm
  `/tmp/CORENAME` actually becomes `MENU`. A `DEPLOY_LOAD=menu` bounce printing `CORENAME=Plex`
  proves **nothing** (it loads Menu then Plex, ending at `Plex` either way).
  **First diagnosis was WRONG — recorded so it is not repeated:** Main pid 30664 sits in `state=R`
  at ~48 % CPU with `utime` climbing, which looks exactly like the documented GPO-mid-handshake
  spin. It is not — the same Main serviced `/dev/MiSTer_cmd` during a `DEPLOY_LOAD=menu` bounce
  (`CORENAME=Plex`). **A busy-looking Main is normal while a core is loaded; only a dead
  `MiSTer_cmd` proves the wedge.** Keyboard is enumerated fine (`SIGMACHIP USB Keyboard` →
  `event0`; Main's `MiSTer virtual input` → `event4`).
- [x] G-STAB1 **`misterplexd` exits during session handoff** — **RESOLVED. Root cause: unhandled
  `SIGPIPE`.** Reproduced deterministically with a `seekTo` on live TNG: the new `PLAY`, the old
  session's `audio pump end` / `session end`, the session-start banner (`FPGA frame path OK`), then
  **nothing** — process gone, port 3005 refusing.
  The silence was the clue. All logging is `fprintf(stderr, …)` and stderr is unbuffered, so no
  message was lost; the process was dying from a signal that prints nothing. `SIGPIPE`'s default
  action terminates silently and leaves **no dmesg record**, which is exactly what we saw.
  Two defects, both fixed:
  1. `SIGPIPE` was never ignored — `main.cpp` installed handlers for SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGCHLD only.
  2. `companion.cpp`'s `sendHttp()` called `::send(fd, …, 0)` without `MSG_NOSIGNAL`, so any client
     that hung up before the response flushed (Plex's long-poll timeline, a timed-out request)
     raised SIGPIPE on the HTTP thread.
  **This one defect also explains G-OSD6.** `SIGPIPE` is not in `installCrashGuard()`'s list
  (SIGSEGV/ABRT/BUS/ILL/FPE/QUIT), so the guard never ran, `Main` was left SIGSTOPped mid-SPI, and
  F12/OSD/`/dev/MiSTer_cmd` all died with the daemon — the "wedged Main" of G-STAB2.
  Verified: seek on live TNG now survives (same pid, new session plays, audio `av-lock`), and
  `Main` stays `state=R` with `CORENAME=Plex`.

- [ ] G-STAB2 **What wedges MiSTer `Main`?** (highest-value stability item) — during this session
  `Main` entered the GPO/SPI ACK spin (`state=R`, `utime` climbing, `wchan=0`) and stayed there.
  Consequences are severe and **silent**: F12/OSD dies (G-OSD6) *and* `/dev/MiSTer_cmd` stops being
  serviced, so `load_core` is accepted then dropped — the RBF on the SD card updates and its md5
  verifies, but **the FPGA keeps running whatever bitstream was loaded when Main wedged**. Four
  consecutive build/deploy/test cycles were invalidated this way before it was noticed.
  Notes: `resumeStrandedMain()` only rescues state **T**, never this spin; Main's handshake loop has
  no timeout. Only recovery found is a reboot (~75 s to SSH; the startup hook re-launches
  `misterplexd`).
  **Next:** determine whether `misterplexd` provokes it (it wedged while the daemon was running),
  and add an automatic detector — probe `load_core menu.rbf` + `/tmp/CORENAME` before trusting any
  deploy, and consider having `deploy_plex_core.sh` fail loudly instead of reporting success.
  **UPDATE — likely answered by G-STAB1.** The daemon was dying from an unhandled `SIGPIPE`, which
  is *not* in `installCrashGuard()`'s signal list. So the guard never ran and `Main` was left
  SIGSTOPped inside an SPI critical section — precisely this wedge. With SIGPIPE ignored and
  `MSG_NOSIGNAL` on the HTTP sends, the daemon no longer dies on that path. Keep this item open
  only to confirm no *other* silent-death path exists: any signal outside
  {SEGV,ABRT,BUS,ILL,FPE,QUIT} strands Main the same way, so consider widening the guard (or
  restoring GPO from an `atexit`/RAII owner) rather than enumerating signals.
  The automatic detector is **done**: `deploy_plex_core.sh` now verifies `CORENAME` actually
  becomes `MENU` and hard-fails (exit 3 wedged / exit 4 never returned to Plex) instead of
  reporting a false success. It fired correctly and caught a real wedge during the edge work.

### misterplexd no longer touches Main (**DONE** 2026-07-26)

**Root cause of "the Plex core keeps crashing Main / F12 is dead".** The HPS<->FPGA "SPI"
is a single GPO register (`0xFF706010`) plus a strobe/ACK handshake, owned by Main. Main's
`fpga_spi()` spins on that handshake with **no timeout**, so rewriting GPO while Main sits
between `strobe=1` and `saw ACK` makes the core drop ACK and Main spin **forever** — no
F12, no OSD, no `/dev/MiSTer_cmd`. `healMainReloadPlex()` then "fixed" that by killing and
re-exec'ing Main after every play; since `/etc/inittab` uses `sysinit` (not `respawn`), any
interruption of that left the board with **no Main at all** until a power cycle.

- [x] G-MAIN1 verified-safe SPI window — stop Main, wait for **every task** in
      `/proc/<pid>/task` to reach state `T`, require Main's enable bits
      (FPGA_EN/OSD_EN/IO_EN) + strobe all clear, restore GPO byte-for-byte, then SIGCONT.
      Retry on busy; fail the call cleanly rather than corrupt the handshake.
- [x] G-MAIN2 DDR OSD mailbox — core publishes `status[15:0]` at **`0x3007F100`**
      (`"PLXS"` + seq) from `ddram_frame_rd`; host reads it with a plain load. Live on
      hardware: `media: OSD via DDR mailbox (no SPI)`. Frame path was already SPI-free,
      so a normal session now touches SPI **zero** times.
- [x] G-MAIN3 bandaid removed — `healMainReloadPlex()` and `ensureMainAlive()` deleted.
      misterplexd never starts, stops, kills or reloads Main. Only `resumeStrandedMain()`
      remains, and it sends **SIGCONT only**.
- [x] G-MAIN4 hardware proof — 4 play/stop cycles, Main pid **28219 unchanged throughout**;
      `screenshot` via `/dev/MiSTer_cmd` produced a new file *after* playback (the exact
      thing that used to need a Main restart); final state `R`, core `Plex`.
- [x] G-MAIN5 unit regression — `tests/unit/test_main_guard.cpp` also asserts no guard
      ever terminates Main.

RBF `06b3cb4836436ba2a60a237dc604eb7a` — 0 errors, timing MET (worst setup slack
0.051 ns, pll_hdmi), ALM 23%, RAM blocks 74%.

**`scripts/deploy_misterplexd.sh` was shipping stale binaries** — it only cross-compiled
`if [[ ! -f "$BIN" ]]`, so once `build/arm/misterplexd` existed no later deploy rebuilt it.
It now always runs `make arm-plexd`. Check this first whenever a fix appears to have no
effect on hardware.

### Fallout / follow-ups

- `tests/hw/test_fbar_fast.sh` and `tests/hw/test_menu_osd.sh` are **OBSOLETE on v3** (they drive the removed
  debug menu; on v3 they would write a bogus A/V offset). Headers now say so.
- Two thread-lifecycle bugs fixed in `media_player.cpp`: `startIdle()`/`stopIdle()` raced the same
  `std::thread` (→ `std::terminate`), and `stop()`'s `fpga_.close()` + `healMainReloadPlex()` ran while the
  OSD poller / idle painter were mid-ioctl (→ crash). Guarded by `idleMu_` / `osdMu_` and an ordered
  retire-then-restart in `stop()`.
- A **third**, intermittent abort was found by stress-running `test_plex_browse.sh` (3/6 repro) and read
  out of a core dump: `~MediaPlayer()` destroyed a still-joinable `std::thread`. Only `stop()`/`play()`
  ever joined `thr_`, so a session that ended on its own left it finished-but-joinable, and SIGTERM →
  `main()` return → destructor → `std::terminate`. Fixed with `MediaPlayer::shutdown()`, which joins
  `thr_`/`audioThr_`/`streamThr_` **before** retiring the idle/OSD threads — the reverse order still
  aborted 1/10, because `threadMain` calls `startIdle()` at session end and would spawn a fresh painter
  after the old one was joined. A `shuttingDown_` latch makes `startIdle()`/`startOsdPoll()` refuse to
  start once teardown begins. **0/15 after the fix.**
- Both `test_plex_browse.sh` and `test_companion_http.sh` now `assert_clean_exit` (daemon must exit 0 or
  143). They previously only asserted HTTP responses, so the abort printed `terminate called without an
  active exception` and the script still exited 0 — that is why this shipped.
- `paintIdle()` must use the same DDR-bulk-then-SPI ladder as the present loop; SPI-only F1 does not land.
- HDMI grabber emits ~20 black warmup frames — single-frame captures must `select=gte(n\,40)`.

Current silicon (`eeff4eee`, source-proven `b5c50c6`) accepts a YUV420P `PLXK` but leaves `PLXF=0/0` and `has_frame=0`; simulation reads `MAGIC_F=0x504c5846`.

| P3-3l2 | Inv quant + IDCT first 4×4 | **EVIDENCE-BACKED MB0 MODULE / FRAME-WIDE GREEN RETIRED** | W-REL: `h264_iq_idct_4x4.sv` + `test_p3_idct_reference_model` in `make unit`; test is an honest C++ reference/source-integration check, not a Verilog simulator. The MB0/block0 handoff is evidence-backed (`y00=73`, mean=62, coeff_csum=0x14; native-I420 scoreboard confirms `got=73 ref=73 abs=0`). The old frame-wide `maeY=0`/`300/300` green is **UNSUBSTANTIATED** as product decode evidence because it came through the retired RGB565 diagnostic/presentation instrument. |
| P3-3l3 | First full MB recon | **EVIDENCE-BACKED HOST FIXTURE / FPGA BLOCKED** | W-REL: checked-in `tests/fixtures/p3_host_recon/mb0_luma_v1.json` gives MB0 luma pred/dequant/post-IDCT/recon for RTL; source vector is fixed 6739 B. This supports MB0/first-MB handoff only; it is not a frame-wide product pass. |
| P3-3l4 | All MBs / frame mae | **UNSUBSTANTIATED GREEN RETIRED / NATIVE-I420 DEBLOCKED RATCHET RETIRED** | Retired claim 1: `tests/fixtures/p3_host_recon/frame_mae_v1.csv` / `test_p3_host_recon_vectors` reported `vector_bytes=6739 mb=300/300 frame=320x240 maeY=0.000000`, but that green cannot stand as product full-frame evidence because the scoreboard path was RGB565/presentation-contaminated. Retired claim 2: native-I420 ratchets reporting 624×480 `510/1170`, 320×240 `155/300`, and wcap `207/300` used a deblocked reference while RTL output was no-deblock. Current frame-MAE status is pending no-deblock native-I420 ratchets with loop-filter provenance declared. |
| P3-3l5 | Hybrid gate product | TODO | |
| P3-3m | Inter prediction scope + host goldens | **BASELINE MODEL DONE / PMS BASELINE FAILS** | W-REL: `docs/phase3-inter-prediction.md`; checked-in P16×16-only Baseline vector `plex_inter_p16_baseline_320x240_12f.264` (27653 B, md5 `fe5ba815…`), `pframe1_mb_v1.json`, `frame_mae_v1.csv`, and `test_p3_inter_pred_vectors` in `make unit`. Baseline Level 3.0 would make scope tractable: P/CAVLC only, no B/CABAC/weighted/interlace; Level 3.0 DPB max at 640x480 is 6 refs = 2.76 MB YUV420. **But W-A4 delivered-stream probe says PMS ignored Baseline request:** branch `feat/a4-sps-baseline` @ `b28e863` requested Baseline/L3.0 (`640x480`, 2500 kbps) but delivered High `profile_idc=100`, CABAC PPS, B-slices (`i=22 p=165 b=115` in 12s), 618×480, ~1344.3 kbps; mpegts target works, final mp4 target returned empty. Product must fail closed/fallback on B/CABAC/non-Baseline; unit now includes a generated High/CABAC/B unsupported probe. DDR3/YUV420 reference store required for any FPGA inter path; BRAM/SDRAM not viable. |
| P3-3n | Real PMS High/CABAC/B decoder sizing | **SCOPE DONE / A NOT SANE NEAR-TERM** | W-REL: `docs/phase3-high-cabac-scope.md` and `test_p3_high_cabac_scope.py` in `make unit`. Final W-A4 sweep says client-only Baseline forcing is impossible: delivered coded 624×480/display 618×480, 1170 macroblocks, 25 fps, High/CABAC/B, 4 refs. CABAC planning demand **8.775 Mbin/s** (300 bins/macroblock), stress **17.550 Mbin/s**. Current `clk_sys`/DDRAM path is 20 MHz, so 1 bin/cycle barely covers stress, 2 cycles/bin fails stress, 3 cycles/bin fails planning. 4 refs + current YUV420 = 2.25 MB; +present/reorder = 2.70 MB; DDR3 required, SDRAM/BRAM not viable. Existing 4×4 IQ/IDCT/recon survives below entropy, but CAVLC walker does not; High may require 8×8 transform detection/support. Verdict: decoding PMS as sent is a full High-profile decoder project; server-side Baseline XML or ARM/FFmpeg fallback is a hard requirement for a sane FPGA-offload path. |

DPB budget closes at 987 B/MB = 1,154,790 B/frame = 28.87 MB/s at 25fps; DDR first, SDRAM escape hatch. `test_p3_dpb_mc_rtl_sim.sh` proves filtered I420 writeback, frame-boundary promotion, IDR invalidation, clamped 21x21/9x9 fetch, 16x16 MC, and partition masks for 16x8/8x16/8x8/8x4/4x8/4x4; red-checks clamp, MC arithmetic, early ref publication, and partition mask. `test_p3_inter_rtl_sim.sh` compares real RTL against `inter_mc_v1.json` (`mv_cases=6`, `partition_cases=10`, `frame_mv_cases=9090`) and red-checks bad interpolation rounding plus bad partition MV. `test_h264_p_slice_modes_rtl_sim.sh` covers P_Skip, P_L0_16x16, P_L0_16x8, P_L0_8x16, P_8x8/P_8x8ref0, sub-MB 8x8/8x4/4x8/4x4, intra-in-P and unsupported mode classification; red-check swaps 16x8 and fails. `slice_hdr_parser.sv` handles non-IDR ref-marking/ref-idx bits before QP and parses P `mb_skip_run` + first P MB type; shared multi-NAL raw `nalu=15 slice=11 idle_between_vcl=1 recon_sig_3b_cycles=39780 p_first_mb_seen=11 p_first_modes=8/2/1 p_first_bad=0`, with forced-`recon_sig=0` red-check. `decode_stub` now routes IDR invalidation and reference promotion through product `h264_deblock_writeback_ctrl` (`filtered_sample_valid` before `filtered_mb_valid`, terminal commit then `frame_boundary`, `ref_ready_pulse` → DPB `frame_done`), while native-I420 ratchets still classify P output as expected-red (`11/11` P frames for both 12f fixtures; `1/1` for wcap). Full-frame output is still diagnostic RGB565 converted to I420, but it is now measured separately for inter: against `ffmpeg -skip_loop_filter all`, 320×240 P frames are `0/3300` MB exact with Y/U/V MAE `76.468417/77.961619/71.610904`. Full native-I420 inter reconstruction, parsed MV deltas, and product deblocked writeback quality remain open. |
| P3-3q | In-loop deblocking | **NORMATIVE EDGE BLOCKS + MULTI-NAL GATE DONE / FRAME SCHEDULER PENDING** | W-A3: `h264_deblock.sv` covers bS derivation (intra, residual, ref/MV, idc=1/2 controls), alpha/beta/tC0 indexing with slice offsets/clipping, luma/chroma edge rules, and a registered edge pipe. `test_p3_deblock_rtl_sim.sh` now sources the ≥2-VCL `wcap_residual14_idr_plus_p` fixture rather than a single-NAL stream and red-checks edge order drift. `test_stream_path_deblock_integration.sh` proves multi-NAL parser handoff, stream QP/deblock controls, chroma bS4 short filtering, picture-boundary preservation, and that filtered samples feed the next reference value; red-checks trip for bS, threshold offsets, chroma-vs-luma behavior, picture boundaries, in-loop reference use, and slice controls. Full frame deblock scheduling/writeback to the DPB/reference store remains the consumer integration step with W-A4/W-REL. |
