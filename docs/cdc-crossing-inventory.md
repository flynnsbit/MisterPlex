# MiSTerPlex CDC Crossing Inventory

**Owner:** w-a3 (DDR frame store, async FIFOs, clock-domain crossing, deblocking)
**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Branch:** `feat/a3-frame-store` @ `610c298`
**Scope:** All crossings between `general[0].gpll` (clk_sys, 20 MHz) and
`general[2].gpll` (clk_ddr, 90 MHz) in the DDR presentation and streaming paths.

---

## Clock domains

Both clocks originate from the same PLL (`pll_0002.v`) with 0 ps phase shift.
Quartus treats them as synchronous and times crossings with a 5.555 ns setup
relationship (clk_sys→clk_ddr) or ~44 ns (clk_ddr→clk_sys).

| Domain | Signal | Frequency | PLL output | STA clock |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| clk_sys | `clk_sys` | 20.000 MHz | `outclk_0` | `general[0].gpll` |
| clk_ddr | `clk_ddr` / `DDRAM_CLK` | 90.000 MHz | `outclk_2` | `general[2].gpll` |

## Doctrine (learned at cost on this project)

### 1. A 2-FF synchronizer on multi-bit data is unsound

`audio_fifo.sv` passed 12-bit binary write/read pointers through 2-FF synchronizers
for the entire life of this project. Multiple bits changing simultaneously can be
sampled mid-transition, producing a pointer value that never existed. Fix: Gray-coded
pointers where only one bit changes per increment. Commit `d86c183`.

**Rule:** The only safe multi-bit CDC mechanisms are:
- Gray-coded async FIFO (`async_fifo.sv`)
- Dual-port RAM with separate clock ports (M10K `line_buf_ram`)
- Protocol-guarded multi-bit signals (held stable for multiple destination cycles
  before a single-bit enable/toggle crosses)

### 2. A single-cycle fast→slow pulse is silent data loss that STA reports as clean

`m1_dout_ready` was a single clk_ddr pulse (11.1 ns) sampled by the clk_sys consumer
(50 ns period). **Beat conservation test measured 7 of 10 CAS latencies dropping the
beat** — the consumer missed the pulse entirely. STA reported the path as timing-clean
because the signal met setup/hold at the destination register; it simply was not high
when the destination sampled. Fix: `async_fifo` on the response path. Commit `3c6d1d2`.

**Rule:** Fixed relative clock rates are not a substitute for a handshake or a FIFO.
Static timing analysis structurally cannot see this class of fault. **Beat conservation
is the test that catches it** — count beats issued by the producer against beats accepted
by the consumer. If they are not equal, data is being dropped.

### 3. Our gate suite cannot catch pulse-drop faults

The project has a substantial gate suite: `rtl-lint`, `quartus-sv-subset`,
`define-parity`, `post-fit-hierarchy`, `post-fit-timing`, `timing-exclusion`,
`confstr-guard`, `test_rtl_invariants.sh` (20 checks), and an anti-evasion timing gate.
**None of these could have caught a bug that dropped 70% of memory beats.** Only a
purpose-built beat conservation count found it. This is not a deficiency in the gates —
it is a structural limitation of static analysis. Pulse-drop faults require simulation
with dual-domain counters.

### 4. "It appears to work" is the most dangerous state

The audio FIFO appeared to work. The arbiter on the wrong clock appeared to work.
`m1_busy` as an unsynchronized combinational crossing appeared to work. In each case
"appears to work" meant "the failure is intermittent, data-dependent, and
indistinguishable from a decode bug." A warning present long enough to be called
"known" is the most dangerous kind.

---

## Beat conservation test pattern (reusable)

For any fast→slow crossing carrying pulsed data:

```systemverilog
// Producer side (fast clock):
integer wr_beats = 0;
always @(posedge clk_fast)
    if (producer_valid) wr_beats = wr_beats + 1;

// Consumer side (slow clock):
integer rd_beats = 0;
always @(posedge clk_slow)
    if (consumer_valid) rd_beats = rd_beats + 1;

// After workload completes:
// assert(wr_beats == rd_beats)
// If not equal, beats are being dropped.
```

Vary the phase relationship or CAS/response latency across runs to exercise all
possible alignments of the fast pulse within the slow sampling window. A test that
passes at one latency and fails at another proves the crossing is alignment-dependent.

See `rtl/tb_arb_beat_conservation.sv` for the reference implementation.

**30 crossings total. All 30 proven safe. 7 were genuinely unsafe and are now fixed.**

## Future crossings (if a dedicated decode clock is added)

See the architecture assessment provided to w-arch. A `clk_decode` (40-45 MHz) would
require approximately:
- 5-6 new async FIFOs (~780 ALMs, 1.9% of Cyclone V 5CSEBA6)
- ~10 new 2-FF synchronizers
- ~66 ns per DPB read overhead (2 clk_decode + 2 clk_ddr sync cycles)
- The `m1_busy` crossing (#21) would become a three-way crossing if shared,
  but this is now properly registered and synchronized.

## Changelog

| Date | Commit | Change |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2026-07-27 | `d86c183` | audio_fifo: binary→Gray-coded pointer CDC |
| 2026-07-27 | `60df5a2` | ddr_bus_arbiter: moved from clk_sys to clk_ddr |

## PRESENT_CLK_PIX_PLL (default OFF — w-clock)

When `PRESENT_CLK_PIX_PLL=1`, `pll_0002` adds `outclk_3` = clk_pix (29.70 MHz default, or 74.25 with `PRESENT_CLK_PIX_74_25`). Product build does not enable this.

| # | Crossing | Dir | Protection |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | present_npx_path group data | clk_sys→clk_pix | async_fifo gray |
| P2 | prefill_go | clk_sys→clk_pix | 2FF |
| P3 | reset into pix | async | 2FF mp_rst_pix* |

SDC: `Plex_clk_pix.sdc` sets asynchronous clock groups clk_pix ⊥ clk_sys and clk_pix ⊥ clk_ddr. Do not false_path residual_csum.

## clk_pix dedicated / async (w-mem 2026-08-04)

See **`docs/cdc-clk-pix-crossings.md`** for the exhaustive file:line table (P1–P11).

Summary of product fixes under `PRESENT_MULTI_PIXEL` + `PRESENT_CLK_PIX_PLL`:
- P2 prefill_go → `cdc_sync_bit` preserve
- P3 reset_pix → `cdc_sync_bit`
- P4 `mp_out_fs` → cadence via `cdc_pulse_toggle` (was bare async pulse)
- P5 `CLK_VIDEO=clk_pix_pll` so CE_PIXEL/RGB share domain with ascal/OSD
- SDC: `Plex_clk_pix_cdc.sdc` (`set_max_delay`, no blanket false_path on data)
