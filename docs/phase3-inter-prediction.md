# Phase 3 inter prediction scope

This is the host-side scoping note for moving beyond IDR-only decode. No device access or
Quartus fit was used.

## Survey first: what Baseline inter actually leaves

Available host-side assets already used as Plex-library/test content are H.264 Constrained
Baseline and contain **I/P only** (no B frames). Exported decoder motion vectors show quarter-pel
motion (`motion_scale=4`) even for Baseline content.

| Source | Frames | Types | B? | Motion-vector partitions | Max motion |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| `assets/avsync/sync_trekmatch_320x240_24_blip.mp4` | 720 | I=60 P=660 | 0 | 16x16=197307, 16x8=658, 8x16=296, 8x8=444 | 9.75×13.00 px |
| `assets/avsync/sync_24fps_blip.mp4` | 720 | I=60 P=660 | 0 | 16x16=195841, 16x8=376, 8x16=1264, 8x8=1436 | 12.50×19.00 px |
| `assets/avsync/sync_60fps_blip.mp4` | 1800 | I=30 P=1770 | 0 | 16x16=516271, 16x8=1314, 8x16=3334, 8x8=3936 | 12.50×20.00 px |
| `assets/avsync/sync_trekmatch_1080p24_blip.mp4` | 720 | I=35 P=685 | 0 | 16x16=5378814, 16x8=1730, 8x16=3562, 8x8=10356 | 55.00×37.00 px |

The checked-in inter vector deliberately pulls the cheap profile lever:

```text
scripts/gen_test_annexb_inter.py → plex_inter_p16_baseline_320x240_12f.264
bytes=27653 md5=fe5ba815b4d67b5b24d7de496facb15b
frames=12 I=1 P=11 B=0 refs=1 has_b_frames=0
x264: cabac=0:bframes=0:ref=1:weightp=0:8x8dct=0:partitions=none
motion vectors=3095, partition set={16x16}, max motion=(72,36) quarter-pel = 18.00×9.00 px
```

`main` now requests the 480p PMS universal transcode as H.264 Baseline Level 3.0:

```text
videoResolution=640x480&maxVideoBitrate=2500&videoCodec=h264
&videoProfile=baseline&videoLevel=30
```

**Baseline changes the feasibility verdict:** inter prediction is no longer “general H.264”.
It is a tractable P-slice/CAVLC problem if the delivered stream really honors the request. Baseline
removes B-slices, CABAC, weighted prediction, and interlaced/field coding from the hardware scope.
That eliminates bidirectional reference lists, CABAC arithmetic decode, and weighted sample math.

**Critical PMS result (W-A4, 2026-07-26): the real server did not honor this constraint.** A
captured 640×480 universal transcode request with `videoProfile=baseline&videoLevel=30` delivered
H.264 **High** profile instead:

```text
ffprobe delivered stream: h264 High, width=618 height=480, level=30, 25/1
host SPS parse: profile_idc=100, level_idc=30, width=618, height=480
PPS parse: entropy_cabac=1
12 s VCL scan: vcl=302 idr=8 nonidr=294 i=22 p=165 b=115
```

So the Baseline-only decoder is feasible as an architecture, but **not yet a safe assumption for
actual Plex 480p output**. Until PMS delivery is proven Baseline/CAVLC/I-P, product code must detect
High/CABAC/B streams and fall back/report unsupported; silent decode is forbidden.

What remains for 480p Baseline:

- P-slice macroblock syntax and CAVLC residuals.
- Motion-vector prediction and `ref_idx_l0` parsing.
- Luma quarter-pel interpolation and chroma eighth-pel/bilinear interpolation.
- P16×16 at minimum; likely P16×8/P8×16/P8×8 unless PMS/x264 can be constrained to
  `partitions=none`.
- Reference-picture storage and frame-num/MMCO guardrails.

If PMS can force `bframes=0`, `ref=1`, `weightp=0`, and P16×16-only partitions, the first hardware
inter rung is much smaller: one past reference frame and one vector per inter MB. Quarter-pel
interpolation remains mandatory. If PMS cannot disable sub-MB partitions, the survey says we must
support at least P16×16, P16×8, P8×16, and P8×8. Direct H.264 Parts can still be Main/High/CABAC
and must be detected/rejected rather than silently fed to the Baseline decoder.

## Goldens added

`tests/fixtures/p3_inter_pred/` contains:

- `plex_inter_p16_baseline_320x240_12f.264` — deterministic Annex-B source vector.
- `pframe1_mb_v1.json` (`format=misterplex.p3.inter_mb.v1`) — frame 1 per-MB motion partition
  data plus reconstructed Y samples.
- `frame_mae_v1.csv` (`format=misterplex.p3.inter_frame_mae.v1`) — all 12 frames × 300 MBs,
  Y-plane MAE versus FFmpeg decode.

`test_p3_inter_pred_vectors` regenerates the vector byte-for-byte, decodes with libav motion-vector
export, verifies the narrow profile (`profile_idc=66`, `level_idc<=30`, CAVLC PPS, `I=1 P=11 B=0
refs=1 parts=16x16`), and checks the JSON/CSV fixtures. Red perturbations cover MV data, MAE rows,
byte-identical regeneration, and unsupported-profile handling. The guard is intentionally
fail-closed: an unexpected B/CABAC or non-Baseline stream must be reported as unsupported, not
decoded incorrectly.

## Hardware cost and memory path under Baseline Level 3.0

Inter prediction is external-memory work, not BRAM work.

| Target | YUV420 reference frame | RGB565 output frame | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 320×240 | 115,200 B | 153,600 B | feasible bandwidth even on modest external memory |
| 640×480 | 460,800 B | 614,400 B | not BRAM-resident; needs external memory |
| 720p | 1,382,400 B | 1,843,200 B | DDR3-only territory |

Level 3.0 caps the decoded picture buffer at **8100 macroblocks**. A 640×480 frame is
`40×30 = 1200` macroblocks, so the Level 3.0 worst-case DPB is:

```text
floor(8100 / 1200) = 6 decoded reference frames
6 × 640×480 YUV420 = 6 × 460,800 B = 2,764,800 B
current reconstruction frame = +460,800 B
worst-case YUV decode/reference working set ≈ 3.23 MB
```

That is impossible in BRAM but easy in HPS DDR3 capacity. It is still more complex than the desired
`ref=1` subset because ref-index parsing and reference-list addressing become real hardware state.
Therefore the first product target should **measure the actual delivered SPS `max_num_ref_frames`**
and fail closed above the implemented reference count.

For 640×480 P16×16 quarter-pel with one active reference, a rough per-frame memory budget is:

- reference read: ~0.72 MB/frame (luma 6-tap halo + chroma bilinear halo)
- decoded YUV reference write: 0.46 MB/frame
- present/output write:
  - RGB565 path: 0.61 MB/frame
  - YUV420 DDR path (`w-c2` direction): 0.46 MB/frame
- total:
  - RGB565 present: ~1.8 MB/frame → ~54 MB/s at 30 fps, ~108 MB/s at 60 fps before inefficiency
  - YUV420 present/reference: ~1.6 MB/frame → ~47 MB/s at 30 fps, ~94 MB/s at 60 fps

If P8×8/sub-MB partitions are allowed, interpolation halos increase reference reads; budget closer
to ~2.2–2.6 MB/frame at 640×480 is a safer planning number (~66–78 MB/s at 30 fps, ~132–156 MB/s
at 60 fps on the RGB565 path, about 25% lower if YUV420 remains native through DDR/present).
Multiple references primarily increase storage and address/ref-list complexity; each partition
still reads from one selected reference, but the decoder must keep enough prior frames resident.

**Architecture implication:** inter prediction should target the DDR3-backed YUV reference store.
The SDRAM path is currently not dependable, and BRAM cannot hold even one 640×480 RGB565 frame.
The reported DDR3 path around ~160 MB/s is enough for 640×480p30 and plausibly enough for
640×480p60 in the narrow P16×16/YUV420 case, but it is tight for sub-MB partitions plus RGB565
conversion traffic. Raising the DDRAM clock toward the expected ~800 MB/s class would make 480p60
comfortable and leave headroom for sub-MB partitions and deblock.

## Coordination note for `w-a4`

`w-a4` landed the 480p profile request (`videoProfile=baseline&videoLevel=30`) and PMS accepted the
request. W-A4's first delivered-stream probe is **negative**: High/CABAC/B was delivered despite
the request. Before hardware depends on Baseline, either make PMS actually deliver profile_idc=66
with PPS `entropy_coding_mode_flag=0`, I/P only, and `max_num_ref_frames` within the implemented
count, or keep the ARM/FFmpeg fallback for that stream.
