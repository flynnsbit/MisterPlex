# Local fits are banned: they starve this box (~4GB free vs ~85GB remote) and Verilator

REFUSED: local Quartus fits are not permitted in this project.

Use the remote build farm instead:
    scripts/build_rbf_remote.sh slotN        # slots 1-4

Do NOT override NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS: it changes the RBF and invalidates the
bit-identity proof. For a new configuration with no local reference, fit the same
source in two slots and require the two RBFs to be bit-identical.

Rationale: a local fit starves this machine, and `make unit` run under that pressure
produces untrustworthy results (measured: phantom `recon_sig 0x0`, `mb_exact=292/300`)
that look exactly like real decode failures.
