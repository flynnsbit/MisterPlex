# Recreate the /tmp -> permanent-store symlinks for lab evidence.
#
# Orchestration logs and per-agent evidence are written to /tmp/misterplex-*
# paths by long-standing convention. /tmp is tmpfs and is cleared on reboot,
# which has already destroyed a session's history once. The real files
# therefore live under ~/Projects/MisterPlex/Memory/lab, and the /tmp paths
# are symlinks into it, so existing agents and scripts need no changes.
#
# Run this after a reboot, or any time /tmp has been cleared.
#
# Memory/ is git-ignored because it holds the lab PMS address, which
# tests/unit/test_no_private_data.sh forbids in tracked files. It sits in the
# primary clone rather than a build worktree so that `git clean -xfd` during a
# build cannot reach it; do not run `git clean -xfd` in the primary clone.
