# Refuse to produce untrustworthy test results.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Verilator under memory pressure returns WRONG ANSWERS, not errors, and those
# answers impersonate the exact decode bugs this project hunts (recon_sig 0x0 is
# both the real divergence signature and the phantom-red signature). A suite that
# reports a confident red it cannot reproduce is worse than a suite that refuses
# to run.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES
# ----------------
# 1. Local Quartus processes. This is the *proven cause* of every phantom red
#    observed so far, not a proxy for it. A local fit peaks around 2 GB RSS on an
#    8-core/16 GB machine and reliably pushes the box into paging.
# 2. Paging RATE (pswpin/pswpout deltas over a sample window), NOT SwapFree.
#    SwapFree is a record of PAST pressure: once the kernel has swapped anything
#    out it stays low indefinitely even when the system is completely idle, and
#    reclaiming it needs swapoff, which needs unavailable sudo. Gating on
#    SwapFree therefore refuses forever, which trains everyone to set the
#    override and makes the gate worse than absent.
# 3. Absolute MemAvailable headroom for Verilator. Paging-rate alone misses
#    steady-state pressure: the documented phantom-red condition happened with
#    low paging rate but only ~6.3 GB available while another process held
#    ~4.7 GB RSS. Refuse before a simulator can return wrong answers.
#
# Override with MISTERPLEX_ALLOW_LOW_MEMORY_TESTS=1 (announces itself loudly).
