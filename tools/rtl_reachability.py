"""Transitive RTL reachability from the design top through the Quartus file list.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The parent orchestrator produced THREE successive wrong answers to the question
"is the fabric H.264 decoder connected?", each with an ad-hoc grep:

  1. Searched for a module whose name equals its FILENAME. No module in this
     codebase is named after its file, so it could only ever return NOBODY.
  2. Re-ran with real module names but with the regex
         ^\\s*MODULE\\s*(#|\\()
     which only matches `foo #(` and `foo (`. It MISSES the ordinary
         h264_idct4x4 u_h264_idct4x4 (
     form, i.e. the most common way to instantiate anything. That silently
     reported 11 live modules in decode_stub.sv as dead.
  3. Even corrected, a flat "who mentions X" grep is not reachability: a module
     instantiated only by an orphan root is still dead.

The fix for a bad probe is a better probe, so this walks the graph properly:
parse the .qip file list, index module declarations, extract instantiations, then
BFS from the top module. Anything not reached is dead regardless of who mentions it.

LIMITATIONS (stated, not hidden):
  - Does not evaluate `generate`/`ifdef` or QSF macros such as PRODUCT_NO_STUB, so
    a module inside a disabled branch is reported reachable here but may not
    survive synthesis. Post-fit hierarchy is the authority for what actually built.
  - Text-based, not a real elaborator.
  - Source-graph LIVE != modules present in a deployed RBF (bitstream may predate
    sources; nostub/PRODUCT_NO_STUB can drop the whole decode_stub branch).
  - Edges are taken from module..endmodule bodies only (not whole multi-module files).
  - Positive/negative controls must pass or the tool exits 3 (no LIVE/DEAD table).
